								<h2 class="mb-4">Simulating Electrons in Materials</h2>
								<p>
								Materials that exploit the behaviour of electrons are at the heart of technologies such as the computer chip, organic solar cell (OSC), battery, electronic visual display, among many others. To devlop advanced and sustainable technologies novel materials are required. 
								</p>
								<p>
								Materials design currently relies on trial and error as well as the expertise and specialised knowledge of researchers, making the process slow and expensive.

		Electrons determine the characteristics of materials, such as colour and texture as well as less familiar properties like electrical and thermal conductivity. Quantum theory describes the behaviour of electrons; however, approximations must be made in order to describe most materials. The introduction of these approximations has led to advancements in technologies such as computer chips, fibre optics and batteries. However, approximations become unreliable in certain scenarios, limiting the development of technology.

								<p>
								In quantum theory the <q>wavefunction</q> fully describes the system. Obtaining the wavefunction for a system which consists of multiple <i>interacting</i> electrons is extremely challenging; it's so computationally demanding that calculating the wavefunction for just a few electrons is beyond the world's most powerful supercomputer.
								</p>
								<p>
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory">Density functional theory</a> (DFT) offers an elegant solution to this problem: The theory states that all the properties of the system which can be calculated from the wavefunction can instead be obtained from the electron probability density, which represents the chance of finding an electron in a given region of the system. Calculating the electron density is far less computationally expensive than calculating the wavefunction. However, approximations must be employed in order to calculate the density and to then <q>extract</q> observables from it.

								<h2 id="KST" class="mb-3 mt-2">Kohn-Sham theory</h2>
								<p>
								The electron density is commonly calculated via Kohn-Sham theory. Within the auxiliary Kohn-Sham system there is no interaction between electrons which means the computational cost of a Kohn-Sham calculation is low. This fictitious system of noninteracting electrons is defined to have the same density as the real system of interacting electrons. The effect of electron-electron interaction on the electron density is captured by the <q>Kohn-Sham potential</q>, which dictates the external forces which act on the noninteracting electrons. The exact form of this potential is generally unknown and hence must be approximated for most situations.
								</p>
								<p>
								Kohn-Sham DFT is the most successful method within condensed matter physics owing to its computationally cheap approximations which are reliable in many scenarios. However, these popular approximations are notoriously unreliable when the electrons undergo excitation. My research aim is to bring the success of Kohn-Sham DFT for electronic structure calculation to the field of electron excitation by developed advanced approximations.

								<h3 class="mb-3 mt-2 font-weight-bold">Introduction</h3>
								<p>
								Modeling real materials using quantum mechanics requires solving the many-body Schr&#246;dinger equation, which describes the behavior of all the electrons in a system. However, solving this equation for even moderately large systems is extremely computationally expensive, and often impossible. Therefore, approximations must be used in order to make the calculations tractable. These approximations often involve simplifying the problem in some way, such as by assuming that the electrons in the system are non-interacting, or by making assumptions about the form of the electronic wavefunction. Despite these simplifications, the approximations used in density functional theory (DFT) are still able to accurately predict the properties of real materials in many cases, but they will not be always able to capture all the details of the system. Specifically, DFT is notoriously unreliable for modelling excitation processes.

								<!--p>
								Kohn and Sham's approach to density functional theory (DFT) owes its success within materials science to its unprecedented balance of accuracy and computational efficiency. DFT is the method of choice for modelling ground-state electronic properties thanks to an abundance of effective approximations to the ground-state <q>exchange-correlation</q> (xc) energy. However, as technologies have become more advanced, the need to calculate electron excitation properties reliably has grown. At present, the approximations that have been so successful for the ground state are unreliable when used to calculate excitation properties. My overall research aim is to bring the success of DFT for the ground state to modelling the excited states.
								</p-->
								<p>
								Kohn and Sham's approach to DFT is the most widely used method for calculating ground-state electronic properties thanks to its reliable and computationally inexpensive approximations. However, these commonly used approximations are unreliable for modelling excited states.   
								</p>
								<p>
								Using our iDEA code, we model prototype systems that mimic the fundamental physics of excitation processes in real materials. By applying iDEA's powerful inversion algorithms, we can study the exact Kohn-Sham potential of the system when electrons are excited. By comparing the exact potential to approximate potentials, which are unreliable for excitation processes, we can gain the insights needed to develop improved, practical approximations needed for reliably modelling excitation processes in real materials.
								<!--We model prototype systems that mimic the fundamental physics of excitation processes in real materials both exactly and with approximations using our iDEA code. We use iDEA's powerful inversion algorithms to study the exact Kohn-Sham potential of the system when electrons are excited. This insight informs the development of advanced approximations.-->

								Our research has shown that the Kohn-Sham potential becomes non-analytic when a charge transfer excitation occurs (<a href="publications.html#Kraisler2021">see publication</a>). We have demonstrated that, in principle, the exact charge-transfer energy can be obtained from the Kohn-Sham system through this discontinuous behavior. Therefore, by using a sufficiently advanced approximation that is able to capture non-analytic behavior (<a href="publications.html#Callow2020">see publication</a>), it is possible to accurately calculate the charge-transfer energy.

								Sources of renewable energy are becoming increasingly important as fossil fuels deplete. OSC technology offers a potentially limitless supply of green energy. However, with an almost infinite number of ways to change the structure of organic compounds, optimising this technology possess an enormous challenge. By far the most efficient and cost-effective way to search for candidate organic materials is to employ high-throughput <i>in silico</i> screening. However, this requires the accurate and computationally inexpensive simulation of electron excitation.

								Ground-state properties are routinely obtained from Kohn-Sham DFT. My research focuses on expanding the scope of this method so that excitation energies are also reliably obtainable from this theory.
								</p>
								<p>
								In 2021 we showed that excitation energies of central importance to materials, such as the charge transfer energy or the optical gap, can be calculated directly from the corresponding Kohn-Sham single-particle energy. We found that the exact exchange-correlation potential is discontinuous upon the excitation of the Kohn-Sham system, and that the magnitude of thess discontinuities relate known Kohn-Sham energies to the excitation energies we want <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c01093" >[E. Kraisler <i>et al.</i> (2021)]</a>.

								When an organic solar cell absorbs light, electrons are excited which leaves available electronic states (holes) in the material. An electrical current can flow provided the electrons and holes do not recombine. Successful charge transfer is vital to disassociate the electron and hole, hence accurately calculating the charge-transfer energy &mdash; the energy to remove an electron from the donor and add it to the acceptor &mdash; is important for the development of organic solar cells. At present even the most advanced computational methods are unreliable, or carry a large computational cost, when predicting charge-transfer energies.

                                                                In principle, Kohn-Sham time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can accurately calculate electron currents. However, existing approximations to the Kohn-Sham potential are known to be unreliable in the presence of strong electric fields. This is because the exact time-dependent Kohn-Sham potential depends on the density throughout the entire system, regardless of the separation of the electrons. Therefore, when the electrons begin to move due to the electric field, the Kohn-Sham potential in the region of each electron must consider the behavior of all other electrons in the system at the same time. As a result, approximating the time-dependent Kohn-Sham potential can be challenging.

								Our research has shown that the flow of electron density (electron current) in the Kohn-Sham system is controlled by dynamic potential differences (PDs) that form within the Kohn-Sham potential (<a href="publications.html#Hodgson2016">see publication</a>). These PDs manifest as steps in the potential (changes in potential over a short distance). Importantly, these dynamic features are not captured by commonly used approximations to the time-dependent Kohn-Sham potential which limits the accuracy of the simulation.
<!--In principle, Kohn-Sham time-dependent DFT can yield exact electron currents; in practice, existing approximations to the Kohn-Sham potential are least secure in the presence of strong electric fields.

								We have developed a novel method for accurately and efficiently simulating electron behavior in molecular junctions within generalised Kohn-Sham theory (<a href="publications.html#Hodgson2021">see publication</a>). By designing the Kohn-Sham potential to be <q>nearsighted</q>, we ensure that it is only concerned with the electron density in its immediate surroundings. As a result, our method reduces the reliance of the potential on steps, allowing simple local approximations to this nearsighted potential to be are more effective than approximations to the traditional, strongly non-local Kohn-Sham potential. To learn more about this method, please watch the video below.

Hence, simple local approximations to this nearsighted potential are much more effective than approximations to the usual strongly non-local Kohn-Sham potential. To find out more watch the video below. 
								one may employ a spatially nonlocal potential within the auxiliary single-particle equations in addition to a multiplicative potential that together ensure the single-particle electron density equals the many-body density. The multiplicative portion of the potential is generally unknown and must be approximated. The form of the nonlocal potential affects the form of the exact multiplicative potential. By employing the nonlocal potential of unrestricted Hartree-Fock, we designed the multiplicative potential to be <q>nearsighted</q> <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.045129">[J. Wetherell <i>et al.</i> (2019)]</a>, meaning that each electron is only concerned with its local vicinity, and thus is more amenable to approximation. The new method successfully yields accurate electronic properties for model prototype molecular junctions.-->

								<!--<p>
								The exact time-dependent Kohn-Sham potential jumps suddenly in regions where strong currents flow &mdash; so called potential <q>steps</q> <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.241102">[M. J. P. Hodgson <i>et al.</i> (2013)]</a>. These features of the potential are similar to those observed for the static Kohn-Sham potential <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.155146">[M. J. P. Hodgson <i>et al.</i> (2016)]</a> and are also extremely difficult to capture in approximations because the potential at a given point in the system depends on behaviour of electrons which are far away from its local vicinity.
								</p>
								<p>
								Within standard Kohn-Sham theory all electrons experience the same potential. This restriction on the potential gives rise to these discontinuous features (the steps and jumps discussed above) <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.045129">[J. Wetherell <i>et al.</i> (2019)]</a>. Generalised Kohn-Sham theory allows the Kohn-Sham potential to be separated into two parts: one part allows different electrons to experience different potentials; the other part is the same for every electron and is required to ensure the dynamic electron density is the same as the interacting density (this part of the potential is generally unknown and hence must be approximated). The form of the first part affects the form of the second part and hence a sensible choice for the first part yields a second part which is more amenable to approximation.
								</p>
								<p>
								Within our approach, we ensure the potential which is to be approximated is <q>nearsighted</q>, i.e., it's only concerned with the electrons in its local vicinity and hence can be approximated on the basis of the local density alone. We demonstrated that our method yields accurate electrical currents for prototype, simple molecular junctions <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/accepted/e0077N44W991131cf72786b87dddc27ab813833a1?fbclid=IwAR1s-C4RTWCkB54DdnXRdksxZhlLaYr8t_TFE3aJ5fbva8xxRWj9uW5P7Hg" >[M.

								<h2 class="mb-4">Many-body perturbation theory</h2>
								<p>
								The wavefunction of a system of interacting electrons cannot be calculated exactly; while the wavefunction which describes a system of noninteracting electrons can. Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) treats the part of the system which cannot be calculated exactly, usually the interaction, as a perturbation. This approach allows the interaction to be systematically included into the theory allowing as many or as few <q>terms</q> to be included as required. The more terms that are included in the method, the more accurate, but also the more computationally expensive the approach. Therefore within MBPT one must obtain a balance between accuracy and efficiency.
								</p>
								<p>
								There are many forms of MBPT. A commonly used method is the so called <q><i>GW</i> approximation</q>, named after the mathematical symbols employed within the approximation. Within the <i>GW</i> approximation the Green function, <i>G</i>, describes the system, like the wavefunction, or the density in DFT. The Green function encapsulates the effects of adding or removing an electron to or from the system of interacting electrons. Therefore it is used to predict electron emission properties.

								<!--The photo-emission spectrum can be used to determine the chemical make-up of materials, which for example can be used to study the conversion of greenhouse gasses into useful chemicals. This spectrum also contains ionisation energies &mdash; the energy to remove an electron from the material &mdash; which yields crucial information about the structure of the material, for example the strength of chemical bonds.
								</p>-->
								<p>
								The spectral function can be obtained directly from a many-body perturbation theory calculation. However, the popular <i>GW</i> approximation is prone to a <q>self-screening error</q>, especially in systems with strong electron localisation, which causes the approximation to yield incorrect ionisation energies. This error occurs because the electrons are screening their own removal. We have shown that this error can be corrected in a computationally efficient manner through the use of a density-functional potential (<a href="publications.html#Wetherell2018">see publication</a>). This correction allows us to obtain accurate ionisation energies in these systems.
